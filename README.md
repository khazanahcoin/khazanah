Khazanah is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to easily send money online

Think of it as “the internet currency”. People should use cryptocurrency in any way they see fit. They are free to buy and free to sell whatever they want. The most valuable part of Khazanah is the community. For that to remain strong it’s best if it’s inclusive and not cliquey, inviting rather than judgmental.
